# General Guidelines

- When creating a file (for example, config files, etc), first ensure that similar files are not already present in the project in may be different directories.
- We're using `poetry` for package management, so never try to run python directly or through a virtual environment.
- While the front-end and back-end is currently intertwined, the long-term goal is to fully separate out the front-end from the back-end and have a clear and clean API that is consumed by the front-end.
