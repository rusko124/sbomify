    <h2>How sbomify Works</h2>
    <p>sbomify organizes your software in a simple way that matches how you build things:</p>
    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>Products → Projects → Components</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Products</strong> are your main software (like "Online Store" or "Banking App")
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Projects</strong> are the different parts of your product (like "Website", "Mobile App", "Payment System")
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Components</strong> are the specific pieces you want to track - like code libraries or apps that make up your projects
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>What sbomify Can Do</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>SBOM Management:</strong> Upload and check Software Bills of Materials to see what's in your software.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Release Management:</strong> Create releases that group specific versions of your software pieces together.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Security Scanning:</strong> Automatically find security problems in all your software.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Team Collaboration:</strong> Work with your team to keep all your software secure.
    </p>
    {% if workspace_name %}
        <p>
            You're currently part of the <strong>{{ workspace_name }}</strong> workspace.
            {% if user_role == "owner" %}You can invite team members and change workspace settings from your dashboard.{% endif %}
        </p>
    {% endif %}
    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>Pro Tip</h3>
        <p>
            Start by creating a product for one of your main software programs.
            Then add a project for a specific app within that product, and finally
            create components for the important software pieces you want to track. This
            step-by-step approach makes it easy to organize all your software.
